\section*{Abstract}
This theses aims on \MIndex{} -- a similarity search structure for multimedia databases and its implementation in Java.
The thesis contains description of \MIndex{} its structures, used algorithms and principles of metric space and similarity searching.
The implementation in Java is then measured with different sets of parameters and results are discussed together with pitfalls of micro-benchmarking code written in Java.
At the end is done performance comparison between \MIndex{} implementations in languages \CC,C\# and Java.
