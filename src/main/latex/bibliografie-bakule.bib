  abstract = {In the Information Society, information holds the master key to economic
	influence. Similarity Search-The Metric Space Approach focuses on
	efficient ways to locate user-relevant information in collections
	of objects, the similarity of which is quantified using a pairwise
	distance measure. This book is a direct response to recent advances
	in computing, communications and storage which have led to the current
	flood of digital libraries, data warehouses and the limitless heterogeneity
	of internet resources.
	
	Similarity Search-The Metric Space Approach introduces state-of-the-art
	in developing index structures for searching complex data modeled
	as instances of a metric space.
	
	This book consists of two parts:
	
	Part I presents the metric search approach in a nutshell by defining
	the problem, describes major theoretical principles, and provides
	an extensive survey of specific techniques for a large range of applications.
	
	Part II concentrates on approaches particularly designed for searching
	in large collections of data. After describing the most popular centralized
	disk-based metric indexes, we present approximation techniques are
	presented as a way to significantly speed up search time at the expense
	of some imprecision in query results, and finally we discuss parallel
	and distributed disk-based metric indexes.
	
	Similarity Search-The Metric Space Approach is designed for a professional
	audience, composed of academic researchers as well as practitioners
	in industry. This book is also suitable as introductory material
	for graduate-level students in computer science. },
